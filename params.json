{"name":"Crobots","tagline":"CROBOTS is a programming game, for programmers (or aspiring programmers.)","body":"This is the source code of the original CROBOTS game that I wrote in 1985, now\r\nreleased under GPLv2.   \r\n\r\nI probably will **not** be updating CROBOTS, so feel free to [fork the code](https://github.com/tpoindex/crobots).\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning in your browser with PCjs\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nThanks to Jeff Parsons and his fantastic [PCjs simulator](http://jsmachines.net), you\r\ncan run CROBOTS in your browser.  This requires a fairly modern machine to achieve the\r\nspeed of the IBM PC at 4.77 MHz.  The virtual diskette boots [FreeDOS](http://freedos.org)\r\nand runs the four demo robots.\r\n\r\n  * Start [CROBOTS PCjs](pcjs/crobots-pcjs.html)\r\n  * **Ignore** the banner that says CROBOTS is \r\n   [Shareware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware),  I don't want your\r\n   money and I don't live in Illinois any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning under DOSBox\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nYou can run the original MS-DOS executable using [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/).\r\nDOSBox is ported to Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OSX, and a few other O/Ses.\r\nDOSBox can be tweaked to run executables as experienced on a 1980's era\r\n[4.77 MHz Intel 8088](http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/4.77_MHz).  \r\n\r\n * Download and install [Dosbox](http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1).  \r\n   For Linux users, you can probably use your package manager to install,\r\n   _sudo apt-get install dosbox_, etc.\r\n * **cd bin**\r\n * Tweak the crobots_dosbox.conf as needed, especially the _cycles_ value.\r\n   The default cycles value is 245, which should be close for modern CPUs.\r\n * Run **crobots_dosbox.sh** or **crobots_dosbox.bat**   \r\n * **Ignore** the banner that says CROBOTS is \r\n   [Shareware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware),  I don't want your\r\n   money and I don't live in Illinois any longer.\r\n \r\nThis should start up CROBOTS with the four demo robots programs.  Programs are\r\nlisted to the screen as they compile.  Once all four are compiled, the match \r\nbegins.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe original manual for CROBOTS is in [docs/crobots_manual.html](docs/crobots_manual.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
